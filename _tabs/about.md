* I am **C0smic** or **TÃ¹n** (for those who know me).
* At the time of writing this, I'm an IT student at VNUHCM - University of Science and a member of [***HCMUS Computer Security Club***](https://web.facebook.com/hcmus.compsec.club).

# Why this blog?
* I created this blog to store my notes in the field of IT in general and Information Security in particular.
* Sometimes I will write about my personal life, but that's not the main focus (and it's not like anyone will give a damn about it anyway lol).

> That's basically it, feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
