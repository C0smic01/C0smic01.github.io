About 2 weeks ago, the lecturer of CSC14003(Introduction to AI) gave us a choice to learn courses from Udemy, Coursera, or any other online learning platform to get that juicy extra credit *chef kiss*. Coincidentally, I have a Git course from Udemy that I got for free a while back, and Git is something that I've been wanting to learn more about. Killing two birds with one stone type of situation, I guess. Ofc, a proof of some sort is required to get the credit and writing a blog post is one of the options. ~~So here I am, writing this blog post to get that extra credit.~~ Without further ado, let's get started.
